* Begins by evaluated boolean_expression
* If the expression evaulates to true, the statement(s) are executed
* Control then returns to evaluate boolean_expression again
* Repeats itself until boolean_expression evaluates to false

while (boolean_expression) {
	// statements
}

Example:
int i = 0;

while (i < 10) {
	System.out.println("i = " + i);
	i++;
}

Result:
i = 0
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
i = 6
i = 7
i = 8
i = 9

Note:
There should be an update statement within the while loop to ensure that the loop does not run forever.

When to use:
If the number of repetitions is not known
