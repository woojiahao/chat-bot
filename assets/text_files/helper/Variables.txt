Identifiers:
* An identifier is a sequence of characters that consist of letters, digits, underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).
* An identifier must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). It cannot start with a digit.
* An identifier cannot be a reserved word.
* An identifier cannot be true, false, or null.
* An identifier can be of any length.
* An identifier must not have any spaces.

Example:
1. areaOfSquare
2. _name
3. name_of_student
4. $identifier

Variables:
* Declaring a variable tells compiler the name of the variable and the type of data it stores.
* Declare a variable only once.

Syntax: <datatype> variablename;

Example: double radius;

Assigning values to variables:
* A variable must be declared before you can assign a value to it.
* After a variable is declared, you can assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=).
* The datatype must be compatible with the value assigned.

Example: radius = 14.6;

Initialization:
* Declare and assign the value to a new variable on the same line

Example: int x = 15;

Constants:
* Represents permanent data that never changes (eg ∏ or pi = 3.14159)
* 3 benefits:
    - Don’t have to repeatedly type same value
    - Makes program easier to maintain (Value assigned in a single location)
    - Makes program readable
* The final keyword ensures that the value cannot be altered/changed.

Syntax: final <datatype> CONSTANTNAME = value;

Example: final double PI = 3.14159;
