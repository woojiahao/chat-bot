* Loop body is always executed first executed by a test on the loop continuation condition
* If condition evaluates to true, execute the loop body again
* Repeat the process until the condition execute loop body again
* Loop body is executed at least once
* Designed for solving problems in which at least one iteration must occur

do {
	// statements
} while (boolean_expression);

Example:
int i = 0; 
do {
	System.out.println("i = " + i);
	i++;
} while (i < 10);

// demonstrating how the do-while loop executes the statements at least once
System.out.println();
i = 1;
do {
	System.out.println("i = " + i);
} while (i < 1);

Result:
i = 0
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4
i = 5
i = 6
i = 7
i = 8
i = 9

i = 1

When to use:
To replace a while loop if the loop body has to be executed before testing the continuation condition
