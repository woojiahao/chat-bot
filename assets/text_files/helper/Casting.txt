Implicit casting:
* You can assign a value to a numeric variable that supports a wider range of values (implicit casting).

Example: double x = 3;

Explicit casting:
* However, you cannot assign a value to a numeric variable with smaller range of values unless you perform type casting (explicit casting).
* Explicit Casting may result in loss of numerical precision.

Example: int y = (int) 3.8;
